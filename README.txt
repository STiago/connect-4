How to run the game: open the file index.html in a modern browser 

If you want to run the tests I wrote for this game please execute the following commands (npm needs to be installed in your system):

npm install # installs dependencies 
npm install # runs the tests 

Note: during this weekend I also took some time to solve the challenge you have in your website. The reference number I extracted from the encrypted message is: 7206660772. The source code of the program I wrote for decrypting the message is included in the folder called challenge. You need to have Python 2.7 installed in your system to run it.


If you have any questions or trouble to run any of the attached programs do not hesitate to contact me on VictoriaSantiagoAlcala@gmail.com
